# Contributing

WebAPIContrib is always **thrilled** to welcome any contributions!

## Where to find help

Before contributing any feature, make sure to discuss it upfront with the team - this can be done on Github in an [issue](https://github.com/WebApiContrib/WebAPIContrib.Core/issues), on [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/webapicontrib) or on [Slack](webapicontrib.slack.com). 

## Code Style

* Indent with spaces (4) instead of tabs.
* Use the `var` keyword unless the inferred type is not obvious.
* Use the C# type aliases for types that have them (ex. `int` instead of `Int32`).
* Use meaningful names (no hungarian notation, no Java-style lower case methods).
* Unit tests should normally accompany any PR
